# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 20 , 2021 (Personal CV Site)

**Today's Progress**: Committed to 100 Days of Code. Started brand new Personal CV Site Project with an idea to eventually make it like an interactive desktop where you can click on bottom toolbar and icons on desktop to view apps/projects/jobs.

**Thoughts:** Really boring just doing the very basic HTML to get the content on there. Copied over CSS styling from old CV page that is basically meaningless to the page as of now

### Day 1: December 31, 2021 (Personal CV Site)

**Today's Progress**: Continued to add HTML Content blah blah.

**Thoughts:** It is a continuation from yesterday as adding all the content to the main HTML page is cumbersome, but allows me to have something to post for people to look at to see it in progress.
