# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 27 , 2021 (Personal Full Stack Developer Resume Site)

**Today's Progress**: Committed to 100 Days of Code. Started brand new Personal CV/Portfolio type website? It is supposed to sort of resemble like a documents website where you can go through and see all my progress life stuff etc.

**Thoughts:** Took me forever to get coding this as I couldn't decide what I wanted to do. Took a walk, kept it simple and boom. 

**Link to work:** Will update
